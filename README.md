### Objective:

To analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in Twitter data to understand public opinion and emotional tone toward specific entities or topics.

### Dataset Used:

Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis â€“ Kaggle

### Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

TextBlob (for sentiment scoring)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting)

WordCloud (for visualizing frequent words)

NLTK (for basic text preprocessing)

### Steps Involved:

Loaded and explored the Twitter dataset, which contains tweets along with their sentiment labels and entity mentions.

### Performed text preprocessing:

Removed stop words, special characters, and URLs.

Converted text to lowercase and tokenized the tweets.

Applied TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity (ranging from -1 to 1) and subjectivity (ranging from 0 to 1).

Classified tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on polarity scores.

Visualized sentiment distribution using bar charts.

Generated word clouds to highlight the most frequent words used in positive and negative tweets.

Explored sentiment trends by entity or topic where applicable.

### Key Insights:

Most tweets had neutral or positive sentiment, indicating a generally favorable or objective tone in the dataset.

Frequently used words in negative tweets were context-specific, often linked to customer complaints or negative experiences.

Sentiment varied significantly based on the mentioned entity or topic, showing how opinions shift across subjects.

### Skills Applied:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text cleaning

Sentiment analysis with TextBlob

Visual storytelling using bar charts and word clouds

Classification of text data based on polarity scores
